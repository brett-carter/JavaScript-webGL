Description:
	For this program I used the code provided by Wayne Cochran for the animation of the robots left arm to implement the rest of the robot. Mirroring the left arm about the y-axis to get the right arm and translating them to be on opposing sides of the body. The body of the robot is a scaled version of an arm segment. Then using the same rectangular segment I scaled it and translated it to create a left leg segment, which after mirroring was used for the right leg. I created a new set of vertices for the feet and head of the robot.
